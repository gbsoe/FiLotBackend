You are the Replit Agent responsible for backend development.

=== CONTEXT ===
Here is the complete audit of the FiLot FRONTEND.  
Use this audit to fully understand the existing Expo app, its architecture, auth flow, data models, and expected backend behavior.

[BEGIN FRONTEND AUDIT DOCUMENT]
<<PASTE THE CONTENTS OF /mnt/data/FRONTEND_AUDIT.md HERE EXACTLY>>
[END FRONTEND AUDIT DOCUMENT]

IMPORTANT:
• This backend MUST remain 100% separate from the Expo frontend.  
• Backend will be consumed by HTTP API calls from the FiLot app later.  
• Follow the audit above so backend design fully matches frontend login, register, profile, KTP/NPWP upload, and session logic.

=== YOUR OBJECTIVES FOR TRANCHE 1 ===

This tranche focuses ONLY on backend bootstrapping — no business logic yet.

1. **Create a new folder**
   ./backend/

2. **Initialize a Node.js backend project**
   • Use TypeScript  
   • tsconfig.json with strict mode  
   • Add eslint + prettier (simple config)  
   • Project must run with:  
     → npm run dev (ts-node-dev)  
     → npm run build (tsc)  
     → npm start (node dist/index.js)

3. **Install core backend dependencies**
   Required:
   - express
   - cors
   - dotenv
   - helmet
   - morgan
   - zod
   - jsonwebtoken
   - bcryptjs
   - multer (for future doc uploads)
   - uuid

   Dev:
   - typescript
   - ts-node-dev
   - @types/node
   - @types/express
   - @types/cors
   - @types/multer

4. **Create base backend structure**
   /backend/src/
     index.ts                    → Express server bootstrap  
     app.ts                      → Express app, middleware  
     config/  
        env.ts                   → environment loader  
     routes/  
        health.routes.ts         → simple healthcheck  
     controllers/  
        health.controller.ts  
     middlewares/  
        errorHandler.ts  
     utils/  
        logger.ts  

5. **Implement basic server**
   • GET /health → { status: "ok", uptime, timestamp }  
   • Global error handler  
   • Logging via morgan  
   • CORS enabled  

6. **Create .env.example**
   PORT=8080
   JWT_SECRET=
   DATABASE_URL=   (for next tranche)
   UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads

7. **Update project root README.md**
   Add a new section:
   "FiLot Backend — Phase 1 (Initialization)"  
   • How to run  
   • Project structure  
   • What has been prepared  
   • What comes next (Tranche 2: Database)  

8. **NO connection to database yet.**  
   That begins in Tranche 2.

9. **Ensure the code is clean, typed, and minimal.**
   This is a pure bootstrap phase.

=== IMPORTANT RULES ===
• DO NOT modify the Expo frontend.
• DO NOT create authentication logic yet.
• DO NOT create profile endpoints yet.
• DO NOT connect to Neon/Postgres yet.
• This tranche sets up clean backend foundation only.

=== WHEN YOU ARE DONE ===
