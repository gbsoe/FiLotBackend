Please run a full audit of the project structure to determine the correct location of the Dockerfile and the buildspec.yml file.

1. Verify the following:
   - Does a Dockerfile exist inside the /backend directory?
   - Is there a buildspec.yml in the project root?
   - Does the buildspec.yml file reference the correct path to the Dockerfile?

2. If the Dockerfile is inside /backend but buildspec.yml is in the project root, then perform the following fixes:
   - Move buildspec.yml into the /backend directory.
   - Update buildspec.yml so that it changes into the /backend directory before running `docker build`.
   - Ensure its contents match this expected structure:

     version: 0.2
     env:
       variables:
         IMAGE_REPO_NAME: "filot-backend"
         IMAGE_TAG: "latest"
         AWS_REGION: "ap-southeast-2"
         ACCOUNT_ID: "070017891928"

     phases:
       pre_build:
         commands:
           - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
           - aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
           - REPOSITORY_URI=$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME

       build:
         commands:
           - echo Building the Docker image...
           - cd backend
           - docker build -t $IMAGE_REPO_NAME .

       post_build:
         commands:
           - echo Pushing the Docker image to ECR...
           - docker tag $IMAGE_REPO_NAME:latest $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME:latest
           - docker push $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME:latest

     artifacts:
       files:
         - '**/*'

3. After fixing, commit and push the changes to GitHub with the message:
   "Move buildspec.yml into backend folder and update for CodeBuild compatibility"

4. Provide me with a verification report summarizing:
   - Where the Dockerfile is located
   - Where buildspec.yml is now located
   - Whether paths inside buildspec.yml are correct
   - Git commit and push status
